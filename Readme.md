# CI RNNR : Runner
This project is a part of POC of building an CI tool using Go.

Currently this code is able to 
- pull a git repo
- set it on specific commit version 
- load configuration from a file **ci.yaml** 
- spin up and docker image
- mount the repo as volume 
- run those commands.

# Todo
Add Grpc interface to call
